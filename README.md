# 2048-Dev-Testing
A 2048 console game written in Java that can play itself to make statistical analysis easier

This is a console game in Java that I wrote a couple years ago. I created it more for fun as a way to test some mathematical strategic ideas that I had concerning the popular app "2048." It is a the same game in a console version with the ability to run it with automated settings for long periods of time to simulate many games over a short period of time. It also keeps track of location percentages and things like that.
